My Sample Song

VERSE 1
Walking down the lonely street
With my heart upon my sleeve
Every step I take tonight
Brings me closer to the light

CHORUS
Take me home where I belong
To the place where I am strong
In your arms I'll find my way
Home is where my heart will stay

VERSE 2
Through the darkness and the rain
I have felt this kind of pain
But I know that morning comes
And the healing has begun

CHORUS
Take me home where I belong
To the place where I am strong
In your arms I'll find my way
Home is where my heart will stay

BRIDGE
When the world gets cold and gray
And I'm lost along the way
I remember who I am
Take me home to you again
