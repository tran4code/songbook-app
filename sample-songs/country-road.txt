Country Road

VERSE 1
Driving down this dusty road
With the radio turned up loud
Windows down and summer breeze
Makes me feel so free and proud

CHORUS
Country road, take me home
To the place where I belong
Rolling hills and open skies
This is where my heart resides

VERSE 2
Grandpa's farm is up ahead
Where I learned to work and pray
Simple life and honest ways
Never gonna drift away

CHORUS
Country road, take me home
To the place where I belong
Rolling hills and open skies
This is where my heart resides

BRIDGE
City lights can't compare
To the peace I find out here
Country road, my faithful friend
Guide me home once again
